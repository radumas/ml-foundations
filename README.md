# University of Washington Machine Learning Specialization
Publishing fully OpenSource iPython notebooks from the [University of Washington Machine Learning Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) using pandas & scikit-learn instead of SFrames & GraphlabCreate. 

I'm skipping the first course, "Foundations" because all of the data for the examples was only available in binary `gl` format.
